The executable must be unzip first so it can find libwinpthread.dll

Also, this dll is x64 base so if you're running 32bit processor you'll need to install 32bit version of this dll. I didn't include it since most CPU today are 64bit anyway.

The executable would fail if you have 32bit version of libwinpthread on x64bit CPU and vice versa 

If you're compiling from source use this build flags:

g++ -static-libstdc++ -static-libgcc project_group2.cpp -o project.exe

Then add the libwinpthread in the same directory as this executable
